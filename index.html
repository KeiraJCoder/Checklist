    <h1>Develop Course Checklist</h1><br><br><br>
    <p>Before you start your time with us here at Code Nation, there are some important things you need to know, should
        understand and have prepared. <br><br>This will make yours and our lives easier as a whole.<br><br> Meaning we
        can get the most out of our time learning together!
        <br><br><br>
        Think of it like day one of starting a new job, you might get an outfit prepared the night before,<br> plan your
        commute, review any of the onboarding information you have been given,<br><br> have a mild panic attack......
        <br>
        <br><br>
        Well hopefully this checklist will help ease that first day anxiety.
    </p><br><br>

    <h2>What even is this place?</h2>

    <br><br>
