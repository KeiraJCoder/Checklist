        <h1>Develop Course Checklist</h1><br><br><br>
<p>Before you start your time with us here at Code Nation, there are some important things you need to know, should understand and have prepared. <br><br>This will make yours and our lives easier as a whole.<br><br> Meaning we can get the most out of our time learning together! 
<br><br><br>
    Think of it like day one of starting a new job, you might get an outfit prepared the night before,<br> plan your commute, review any of the onboarding information you have been given,<br><br> have a mild panic attack...... <br>
<br><br>
    Well hopefully this checklist will help ease that first day anxiety. </p><br><br>

    <h2>What even is this place?</h2>
<br><br><p>We have prepared this page for any new students coming onto our 3 week Develop course, including links to pages to download any software you need to complete the course.<br><br>
<p>Before you start with us please ensure you have downloaded all of the listed sofware, located at the top of the page</p> <br><br><br><br></p>
<h3>What do I do now?</h3><br>
<p>Make sure you download the software from the above links prior to day 1 of the course</p>
<p>This will mean we can get underway as soon as your course starts!</p><br><br><br>

<h3>What if I have more questions?</h3>
<p>Luckily we have provided more links for you to have a look at if you need more support</p>
<p>This includes information on the Develop course and Frequently asked questions</p>
